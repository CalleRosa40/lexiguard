## Notes

Bias!!!

The project was our first trip into the field of NLP. It was thus foremost about learning and trying out things. Many of these things did not make it into the final project version but can still be found in the /archive folder. Some examples of what we have tinkered around with:

[[See funnel graphic!]]

- POS tagging
- SpaCy vectors
- TF-IDF
- BERT
- Transformers lib
- Pickle
- SMOTE
- fastText

[[Move this section to README in /archive?]]
